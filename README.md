# MadLove
In 2018 Gurkiman posted a short animation of a breakout-style video game in which a lung was destroyed by a cigarette. When Avra asked him if this game was real, he replied "of course not". That's when the idea was born. After a quick prototype we decided to make a real arcade game.

The original MadLove Game comes with a custom built 80s style arcade cabinet with a real CRT monitor, arcade buttons and stick. And of course it is coin operated. Seasoned players are able to enter their name on the top 10 high scores list.
Avra developed the game in Python using Pygame. It features graphics by Gurkiman and Music by Ozzed.
The project premiered at the Rundgang of the State Academy of Fine Arts Stuttgart 19th - 21st of July 2019. In addition, the game was displayed in two bars in Stuttgart and was also playable in Dresden at a festival. The local press reported about the project. (Stadtkind Stuttgart, Tagblatt)
